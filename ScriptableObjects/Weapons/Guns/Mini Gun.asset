  description: M134 is a formidable and iconic rotary machine gun known for its high
    rate of fire and immense firepower. It features multiple barrels that rotate
    to rapidly fire rounds, typically 7.62mm or .308 caliber, and can be operated
    from a vehicle, aircraft, or tripod mount. With its devastating firepower, the
    M134 is capable of quickly dispensing a large number of rounds, making it a potent
    weapon in combat situations where overwhelming force is required. However, its
    size and weight can make it challenging to maneuver
